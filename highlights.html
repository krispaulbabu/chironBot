“I must say, Percy,” Chiron- Brunner broke in, “I’m glad to see you alive. It’s been a long time since I’ve made a house call to a potential camper. I’d hate to think I’ve wasted my time.”

“My year at Yancy Academy, to instruct you. We have satyrs at most schools, of course, keeping a lookout. But Grover alerted me as soon as he met you. He sensed you were something special, so I decided to come upstate. I convinced the other Latin teacher to… ah, take a leave of absence.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 65
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Chiron nodded. “Honestly, I wasn’t sure about you at first. We contacted your mother, let her know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were ready for Camp Half- Blood. But you still had so much to learn. Nevertheless, you made it here alive, and that’s always the first test.”

“Percy,” he said. “Did your mother tell you nothing?”

“I’m afraid there’s too much to tell,” Chiron said. “I’m afraid our usual orientation film won’t be sufficient.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 66
</div>
<div class="noteText">
“No,” Chiron decided. “Well, Percy. You know your friend Grover is a satyr. You know”— he pointed to the horn in the shoe box—“ that you have killed the Minotaur. No small feat, either, lad. What you may not know is that great powers are at work in your life. Gods— the forces you call the Greek gods— are very much alive.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 67

“Well, now,” Chiron said. “God— capital G, God. That’s a different matter altogether. We shan’t deal with the metaphysical.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 67

“Ah, gods, plural, as in, great beings that control the forces of nature and human endeavors: the immortal gods of Olympus. That’s a smaller matter.”

“Yes, quite. The gods we discussed in Latin class.”

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 68
</div>
<div class="noteText">
“Percy,” Chiron said, “you may choose to believe or not, but the fact is that immortal means immortal. Can you imagine that for a moment, never dying? Never fading? Existing, just as you are, for all time?”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 68
</div>
<div class="noteText">
“Exactly,” Chiron agreed. “If you were a god, how would you like being called a myth, an old story to explain lightning? What if I told you, Perseus Jackson, that someday people would call you a myth, just created to explain how little boys can get over losing their mothers?”

“Mr. D,” he warned, “your restrictions.”

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 69

<div class="noteText">
Chiron winked at me. “Mr. D offended his father a while back, took a fancy to a wood nymph who had been declared off- limits.”

Chiron nodded, though he looked a bit troubled. “Old Dionysus isn’t really mad. He just hates his job. He’s been… ah, grounded, I guess you would say, and he can’t stand waiting another century before he’s allowed to go back to Olympus.”

<div class="noteText">
“Well now, there’s Mount Olympus in Greece. And then there’s the home of the gods, the convergence point of their powers, which did indeed used to be on Mount Olympus. It’s still called Mount Olympus, out of respect to the old ways, but the palace moves, Percy, just as the gods do.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 72
</div>
<div class="noteText">
“Well, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 72
</div>
<div class="noteText">
“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just an abstract concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it. You might even say they are the source of it, or at least, they are tied so tightly to it that they couldn’t possibly fade, not unless all of Western civilization were obliterated. The fire started in Greece. Then, as you well know— or as I hope you know, since you passed my course— the heart of the fire moved to Rome, and so did the gods. Oh, different names, perhaps— Jupiter for Zeus, Venus for Aphrodite, and so on— but the same forces, the same gods.”
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) -  Page 72
</div>
<div class="noteText">
“Died? No. Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods. Every place they’ve ruled, for the last three thousand years, you can see them in paintings, in statues, on the most important buildings. And yes, Percy, of course they are now in your United States. Look at your symbol, the eagle of Zeus. Look at the statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center, the Greek facades of your government buildings in Washington. I defy you to find any American city where the Olympians are not prominently displayed in multiple places. Like it or not— and believe me, plenty of people weren’t very fond of Rome, either— America is now the heart of the flame. It is the great power of the West. And so Olympus is here. And we are here.”

“Who are you?” he mused. “Well, that’s the question we all want answered, isn’t it? But for now, we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven. There will be new friends to meet. And plenty of time for lessons tomorrow. Besides, there will be s’mores at the campfire tonight, and I simply adore chocolate.”

“I might agree with you,” Chiron said. “But it is not my place to judge. Dionysus and the Council of Cloven Elders must decide. I’m afraid they might not see this assignment as a success. After all, Grover lost you in New York. Then there’s the unfortunate… ah… fate of your mother. And the fact that Grover was unconscious when you dragged him over the property line.
